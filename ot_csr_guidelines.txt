Oyu Tolgoi Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
2026 Call for Proposals: Youth Development & Education
Strategic Alignment: "Partnering for Prosperity"

1. OVERVIEW
Oyu Tolgoi is committed to sustainable national development. 
Under our "People" and "Partnerships" pillars, we actively seek to fund initiatives that build long-term capacity in Mongolian youth. 
We are expanding our focus beyond our traditional Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund (DSF) to include national-level emotional intelligence and literacy programs.

2. STRATEGIC PRIORITIES
Proposals must align with at least one of the following strategic priorities:
- Mental Health & Emotional Intelligence: Building on the success of our "Gerelt" adolescent mental health project (which has reached over 56,000 students), we are seeking early-intervention emotional intelligence programs for primary school children.
- Literacy & Education: Initiatives that provide translated, high-quality international educational materials to public schools.

3. FUNDING TIERS & SROI REQUIREMENTS
To ensure our investments create measurable impact, all proposals are evaluated on their Social Return on Investment (SROI) and Cost-Per-Child metrics.

- Tier 1 (Pilot Program): Maximum funding of $15,000 USD. 
  Requirement: Must reach a minimum of 500 students. Maximum allowable cost-per-child is $30.
- Tier 2 (District Expansion): Maximum funding of $50,000 USD.
  Requirement: Must reach a minimum of 2,500 students. Maximum allowable cost-per-child is $20.
- Tier 3 (National Rollout): Funding up to $150,000 USD.
  Requirement: Must demonstrate a localized SROI of at least 150% (Every $1 invested generates $1.50 in social value, calculated via long-term educational retention).
